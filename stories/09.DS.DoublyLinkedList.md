#   Doubly Linked Lists
Almost identical to Singly Linked Lists, except every node has another pointer, to the previous node!

**More memory === More Flexibility , It's almost always a tradeoff!**

## DoublyLinkedList Class
### Proberities
* length -> length of linked list.
* head -> pointer refer to first node in linked list.
* tail -> pointer refer to last node in linked list.
### Methods
* push(val) : Adding a node to the end of the Doubly Linked List.
* pop() : Removing a node from the end of the Doubly Linked List.
* shift() : Removing a node from the beginning of the Doubly Linked List.
* unshift(val) : Adding a node to the begin of the Doubly Linked List.
* getByIndex(index) : retriving node from doubly linked list according it's index/postion [0-based].
* setNodeValueByIndex(index, value) : Changing the value of a node based on it's index/position in the Double Linked List
* insert(index, value) : Adding a node to the Double Linked List at a specific position
* remove(index) : Removing a node from the DoublyLinked List at a specific index/position
