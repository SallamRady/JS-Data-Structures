#   MULTIPLE POINTERS
Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition

Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

## Two Pointers
Two pointer approach is an essential part of a programmerâ€™s toolkit, especially in technical interviews. The name does justice in this case, it involves using two pointers to save time and space. (Here, pointers are basically array indexes).

Just like Binary Search is an optimization on the number of trials needed to achieve the result, this approach is used for the same benefit.
