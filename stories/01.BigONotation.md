# Big O Notation

## 1- Time Complexity

Imagine we have multiple implementations of the same function.

### How can we determine which one is the best ?

Big O notation will help us to determine that

### These rules won't ALWAYS work, but are a helpful starting point

- Arithmetic operations are constant
- Variable assignment is constant
- Accessing elements in an array (by index) or object (by key) is constant
- In a loop, the the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside of the loop

# 2- Space Complexity

We can also use big O notation to analyze space complexity:

how much additional memory do we need to allocate in order to run the code in our algorithm?

## Rules to calc Space Complexity in JS.

- Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are constant space
- Strings require O(n) space (where n is the string length)
- Reference types are generally O( n), where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)
