#   BUILT-IN DATA STRUCTURES
Let's spend a couple minutes analyzing the things we do all the time in JS: working with Arrays, Objects, and built-in methods.

##  1. Objects
<b>When to use objects</b>
*   When you don't need order
*   When you need fast access / insertion and removal
<b>When you don't need any ordering, objects are an excellent choice!</b>
### Big O of Object Operations
*   Insertion -   O(1)
*   Removal -   O(1)
*   Searching -   O(N)
*   Access -   O(1)

### Big O of Object Methods
*   Object.keys(objectName) -   O(N)
*   Object.values(objectName) -   O(N)
*   Object.entries(objectName) -   O(N)
*   objectName.hasOwnProperty -   O(1)

##   2. Arrays
### WHEN TO USE ARRAYS
*   When you need order
*   When you need fast access / insertion and removal (sort of....)
### Big O of Arrays
*   Insertion -   It depends on where you will insert in array
*   Removal -   It depends  on where you will delete from array
*   Searching -    It depends on algorithm you are use
*   Access -   O(1)

### Big O of Array Operations
*   push -   O(1)
*   pop -   O(1)
*   shift -   O(N)
*   unshift -   O(N)
*   concat -   O(N)
*   slice -   O(N)
*   splice -   O(N)
*   sort -   O(N * log N)
*   forEach/map/filter/reduce/etc. -   O(N)
