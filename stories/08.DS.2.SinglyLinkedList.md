#   Singly Linked Lists

##  What is a linked list?
A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.

Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

##  Comparisons Lists with Arrays 
### Lists
*   Do not have indexes!
*   Connected via nodes with a next pointer
*   Random access is not allowed
### Arrays
*   Indexed in order!
*   Insertion and deletion can be expensive
*   Can quickly be accessed at a specific index

## SinglyLinkedList Class
 ### **** Proberities ****
 * length -> length of linked list.
 * head -> pointer refer to first node in linked list.
 * tail -> pointer refer to last node in linked list.
 ### **** Methods ****
 * 1. push(val) : add new node to last of linked list.
 * 2. pop() : remove last node in linked list.
 * 3. shift() : remove first node in linked list.
 * 4. unshift(val) : add new node to the begin of linked list.
 * 5. getByIndex(index) : retriving node from linked list according it's index/postion [0-based].
 * 6. setNodeValueByIndex(index, value) : Changing the value of a node based on it's index/position in the Linked List
 * 7. insert(index, value) : Adding a node to the Linked List at a specific position
 * 8. remove(index) : Removing a node from the Linked List at a specific index/position
 * 9. reverse() : Reversing the Linked List in place!
