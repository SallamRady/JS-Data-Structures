#   Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns
##  WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?
A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

##   <span style='color:red'>It's the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer</span>

##  PROBLEM SOLVING 
*   Understand the Problem
*   Explore Concrete Examples
*   Break It Down
*   Solve/Simplify
*   Look Back and Refactor

### In step 1 : UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
*  Can I restate the problem in my own words?
*  What are the inputs that go into the problem?
*  What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
*  Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
*  How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## In Step 2 : EXPLORE EXAMPLES
*  Start with Simple Examples
*  Progress to More Complex Examples
*  Explore Examples with Empty Inputs
*  Explore Examples with Invalid Inputs


##  In Step 5: REFACTORING QUESTIONS
*   Can you check the result?
*   Can you derive the result differently?
*   Can you understand it at a glance?
*   Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
*   Can you improve the performance of your solution?
*   Can you think of other ways to refactor?
*   How have other people solved this problem?
