#   Recursion
###  What is recursion?
A process (a function in our case) that calls itself
### How recursive functions work
Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case!
### Base Case
The condition when the recursion ends.
This is the most important concept to understand 
### What about big O?
*   Measuring time complexity is relatively simple. You can measure the time complexity of a recursive function as then number of recursive calls you need to make relative to the input
*   Measuring space complexity is a bit more challenging. You can measure the space complexity of a recursive function as the maximum number of functions on the call stack at a given time, since the call stack requires memory.
